# GFweb and GFhtml
This is an experimental module with the objective of converting a desktop app created using GUIDeFATE into a web app.  The application will: -

1. Create a websocket server listening currently to localhost at port 8085 (called the calling application name+.html)
2. Generate a client application which it will lauunch immediately in a browser
3. Also produce a pop up window logging the messaging and processing of the messages

# Prerequisites:
1. Popups must be enabled for the app to work (this is obliatory for this iteration, but will become optional)
2. The application needs to be started from a terminal in the folder containing all the dependent files.
3. The only dependencies are 1) Net::WebSocket::Server and 2) a Websocket capable browser (e.g Chrome)

# Notes:
Some messages are duplicated, and some are out of sync.  It is this that appears to cause errors. Trapping them will make it more effective.
