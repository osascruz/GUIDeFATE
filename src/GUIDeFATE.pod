=head1 EXPORTS

getFrame()
returns an object containing Widgets (referencesd by id) and
GUI interaction functions. This is actually provided by the middle-man
((GFwx, GFtk etc) but not availlable for GFhtml

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GUIDeFATE enables the user to convert a textual representtaion into a
Graphical user Interfac. It attempts to abstract out the underlying
framework.  A visually recognisable pattern is passed as a string to
GUIDeFATE and this is transformed into an Interactive Interface.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Creation

=over 4

=item my $gui=GUIDeFATE->new($window, $backend, $options);

Extracts dimensions and wdigets in a window from the textual
representation.
If $backend not provided, defaults to "Wx"; options are Wx and Tk,
Gtk and Qt.
If $options contains "v", then a verbose output is sent to console,
if it contains "a", and autogenerated file is produced with all the
called functions

=item my $frame=$gui->getFrame || $gui;

Returns reference to the frame for both abstracted and backend
specific functions.
