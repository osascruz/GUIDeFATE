This is a test environment for those who wnat to test it GF Win32 interface without installing GUIDeFATE.

Prerequisites: -

* perl (e.g. ActiveState Perl)
* Win32::GUI
* Image::Magick

I used Starwvberry perl and the ImageMagick that comes when you ppd install Image::Magick.
I tried Image Magick v7x from the website and failed to get that to work.
I also failed to get Win32::GUI::DIBitamp which is why you need Image Majick (to allow multiple formats of images. ) Image Magick is used to resize Image, Save as Bitmap into a temp file(GFtmp.bmp, and load that into the application.  

Use this preferably without having installed GUIDeFATE to tes it properly
Unpack folder. Run the applications in the scripts folder

Use the Executioner in the scripts folder to launch other example scripts, currently only a calculator is supplied, a text editor, and rpsls are provided
