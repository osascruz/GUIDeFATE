# GFweb and GFhtml
This is an experimental module with the objective of converting a desktop app created using GUIDeFATE into a web app.  The application will: -

1. Create a websocket server listening (by default localhost at port 8085), which can be declared on running.
2. Generate a client application which it will lauunch immediately in a browser (called  <calling application name>$port.html)
3. Also produce a pop up window logging the messaging and processing of the messagesb (using "d" in the assist paraemeter of `GUIDeFATE->new()` ).  This logging mesages are otherwise passed to the browse]r console.

# Prerequisites:
1. Popups needs be enabled for the app to generate debugging window  `
2. The application needs to be started from a terminal in the folder containing all the dependent files.
 . The only dependencies are 1) Net::WebSocket::Server 2) IO::Socket::PortState and 3) a Websocket capable browser (e.g Chrome)
